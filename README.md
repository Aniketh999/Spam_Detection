<h1 align="center" id="title">Spam Detection-ML Using python</h1>

<p id="description">This project aims to develop a spam detection system using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) based on the content of the email.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Data Preprocessing: The project includes techniques for cleaning and preprocessing email data such as text normalization stop word removal and feature extraction.
*   Model Training: The project explores various machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression to train a spam detection model.
*   Model Evaluation: The project includes methods for evaluating the performance of the trained model such as accuracy precision recall and F1-score
*   Deployment: The project provides a way to deploy the trained model as a web application or an API allowing users to classify new emails as spam or ham.
